# WordPress Barebones Template with Bootstrap (SASS) + Gulp

This is just a repo for my own use. It is a basic WordPress theme with a gulp file to compile Bootstrap (SASS) into a dist folder.

You can use it if you like, just clone it, but it was not designed for anyone to use but myself so use at your own risk.
